# Wallet Integration Guide

This describes how to integrate Aptos and Aptos assets into a wallet.  It provides
generic information for tracking balances, transferring assets, and testing the integration.

# Wallet Creation

## Supported Key types

## Key Derivation

## Private Keys Exporting

## Wallet Importing

## Hardware Support


# Transactions

## Simulating Transactions (optional - but highly recommended)

## Gas Estimation

## Signing Transactions

## Submitting Transactions

## Waiting on Transactions

## Displaying Previous Transactions

## Wallet Adapter (connecting to dapps)

Follow these guides to integrate your wallet with Aptos dapps:
* [As a browser extension wallet or a mobile wallet](../sdks/wallet-adapter/browser-extension-wallets)
* [As an SDK wallet (e.g. an embeddable web or telegram wallet)](../sdks/wallet-adapter/mobile-wallets)

# Assets

Below are the different types of standards of assets on the Aptos blockchain, and
how to handle them.

## Fungible Tokens

These are tokens that are interchangeable with each other.  They are often used
for cryptocurrencies.

### Coins

#### Listing owned Coins

Aptos provides in the [Aptos TypeScript SDK](../sdks/typescript-sdk) a function to
[list all coins and fungible assets owned by an account](https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-ts-sdk/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk-1.33.1/classes/Aptos.html#getCurrentFungibleAssetBalances).

```ts
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
const aptos = new Aptos(new AptosConfig(Network.Devnet));

await aptos.getCurrentFungibleAssetBalances({ownerAddress: "0x1"}); // List of tokens owned by 0x1
```




#### Displaying

#### Transfers

### Fungible Assets

These are fungible assets that can be used interchangeably with each other.  They
replace the coin standard and are used for currencies such as USDt and USDC.

#### Listing owned Assets



#### Displaying

#### Transfers

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs or Digital Assets)

These are tokens that are unique and not interchangeable with each other.  They are
often used for digital collectibles, art, and other unique assets.

### Digital Assets Standard

The Digital Assets standard replaced the Legacy Token standard for new NFTs.  It
is the standard for all new NFTs created on the Aptos blockchain.

#### Listing owned Digital Assets

Aptos provides in the [Aptos TypeScript SDK](../sdks/typescript-sdk) a function to list all NFTs combined
between types.  This is useful for wallets to display all NFTs in a single list.

```ts
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
const aptos = new Aptos(new AptosConfig(Network.Devnet));

await aptos.getOwnedDigitalAssets({ownerAddress: "0x1"}); // List of tokens owned by 0x1
```

See more details on the [TypeScript docs](https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-ts-sdk/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk-1.33.1/classes/Aptos.html#getOwnedDigitalAssets)

#### Displaying Digital Assets

The token URL is the primary way to display the digital asset in a wallet.  The URL can either be
a URL pointing to a JSON file containing an `image` field, or a URL pointing to an image, mp4, or other media file.

Note that the URL can be either an HTTP or an IPFS URL.  IPFS URLs are recommended for IPFS-hosted content, rather
than using the HTTP gateway URL.

Example [metadata JSON](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeieswhmk4eyd2t2bfj3dhetq2x4g46vlvvnsnjdziosm5y25hin5bq/847.json):

```json
{
  "name": "Aptomingo #847",
  "description": "1212 flamingos on the Aptos blockchain striving for a stronger and more educated ecosystem. The first of hopefully many interesting experiments conducted by B.FLY LABS.",
  "image": "ipfs://bafybeidlvhvnnnl3zznatgio6gvd3xsss5uszc7fuwzsqn2ttzknosnxly/847.png",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Background",
      "value": "Azure"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Transferring Digital Assets

Digital Asset transfers are simple.  In order to transfer a digital asset, you need to know the address
of the asset (also known as the `token_id`), and the address of the receiver.

To transfer a digital, call `0x1::object::transfer` with the `token_id` and the receiver address.
The TypeScript SDK provides a function to [transfer a digital asset](https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-ts-sdk/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk-1.33.1/classes/Aptos.html#transferDigitalAssetTransaction)

```ts
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
const aptos = new Aptos(new AptosConfig(Network.Devnet));
const sender = Account.fromPrivateKey("private key");
const rawTxn = await aptos.transferDigitalAssetTransactions({sender, digitalAssetAddress: "0x1213456", recipient: "0x111111111"}); // List of tokens owned by 0x1
// ...
```

### Legacy Token Standard

The Legacy Token standard only applies to NFTs created before the Digital Assets
Standard was introduced.  It is rarely used on new collections, and likely will
not apply much to your wallet.  However, it is still supported for backwards compatibility.

Tokens are referred to by the tuple of:
* `creator` - the address of the account that created the collection
* `collection` - the name of the collection
* `name` - the name of the token within the collection

Tokens are uniquely named and cannot be duplicated within a collection.

Additionally, there is a `property_version` field that keeps track of which version
to transfer of the token.  You should always transfer the latest version of the token.

For more information about the standard see: [Legacy Token Standard](../smart-contracts/standards/legacy-token).

#### Listing owned Legacy Tokens

See [Listing owned Digital Assets](#listing-owned-digital-assets) for how to list owned tokens.

#### Displaying Legacy Tokens

See [Displaying Digital Assets](#displaying-digital-assets) for how to display tokens.

#### Transferring Legacy Tokens

Transfers of Legacy Tokens are controlled, meaning that users must opt in for
receiving tokens from other users.  This is a security feature to prevent spam.

In order to opt in, call the [0x4::token::opt_in_direct_transfer](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move#L601-L607)
entry function to opt in to receiving tokens from any sender.

Then to send a token to a user who has opted in, call the [0x4::token::direct_transfer_script](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token.move#L588-L599)
entry function to send to the receiver.

##### Offering / Claiming Legacy Tokens

If the receiver does not opt in, the sender can offer the token to the receiver.
The receiver can then accept the token, which will opt them in to receiving the token.

To offer, call the [0x4::token_transfers::offer_script](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token_transfers.move#L95-L106)
entry function for the token.

To claim, call the [0x4::token_transfers::claim_script](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token_transfers.move#L151-L161)
entry function for the token.

To cancel an offer, call [0x4::token_transfers::cancel_offer_script](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-token/sources/token_transfers.move#L198-L208)
entry function for the token.
