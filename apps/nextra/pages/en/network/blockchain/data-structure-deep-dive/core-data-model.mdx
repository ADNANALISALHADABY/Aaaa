# The Aptos Core Data Model

Viewed from 30000 feet, the Aptos blockchain is a state machine with transactions driving its state transition.
The latest state is replicated on every validator node and fullnode across the network,
the consensus and state sync protocols ensure that all nodes record the exact same state transitions.
