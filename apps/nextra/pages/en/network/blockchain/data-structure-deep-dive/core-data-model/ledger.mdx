## The Ledger

"The ledger" or "the ledger history" is the totality of all the state transitions that have ever happened on the blockchain.
In theory, with merely the transactions themselves one can recalculate whatever happened on the chain at any point in time.
But that requires the one who's recreating the history has access to a backward compatible Move VM implementation and
the relevant part of the state at that point that's involved in the state transition represented by a transaction.

In reality, the transactions themselves and the side effects of the state transitions, dubbed transaction outputs are
stored as the ledger history.

For each state transition, notable things persisted:

### Version

A sequence number identifying the state transition. The first state transition, or "the genesis", has version 0
and each state transition following that has a version number that's one greater than the previous one. There is no gaps
in the sequence of versions, i.e. we know there is exactly 1 other state transition between transition 1000
and transition 1002.

### Transaction

Represents the intention of a blockchain user to change the state of the blockchain, and how she's willing to change it.
A transaction is a signed message that contains the sender's account address, the sender's public key, the payload of the transaction.
A transaction can be submitted
Only "accepted" transactions are recorded in the ledger, on the contrary, "discarded" transactions are not part of the
ledger and it's only possible to know
